### Entry 1:

**Date:** January 15, 2023
**Error:** NameError: name 'num' is not defined
**Description:** Tried to print the value of the variable 'num', but received a NameError. The code snippet was part of a function where 'num' should have been assigned a value before being used.
**Steps Taken:**
* Reviewed the code and confirmed that 'num' was indeed declared.
* Checked for any typos or misspellings.
* Realized that I mistakenly deleted the line where 'num' was assigned a value. Resolution: Added the line 'num = 10' before the print statement, and the error was resolved.
