## Student Instructions for Completing PBM

You are to build upon your original theme park ride project, enhancing it with additional features and functionalities. This expanded project should demonstrate a comprehensive application of the skills you have learned in the course. While enhancing your project, you are also required to document your learning process and reflect on your development journey.

## Final Project Criteria

### Rides.py – Original file from q3 project. 
* Header Comments
* Modify it by using new code we have learned to streamline some of the processes that we originally had.
* Remove part of the code that now will be in main.py
* Make sure comments are updated to reflect any new code.
* Make sure header is placed properly and all sections needed are filled in appropriately.

### General.py – Park Information Page
* Header Comments
* **Information:** Provide information about park rules, lost and found services, and first aid stations (locations, times, etc).
* **Park Hours:** Display opening and closing times, and any special hours for different sections of the park.

### Concessions.py – Concession stand information
* Header Comments
* **Food and Drink Menus:** Implement a menu system for various food stalls and concession stands, offering items like snacks, meals, and beverages. Include prices and special deals.
* **Locations:** Make sure you have concessions spread out amongst your park and let users know where they are located.  Places can be in multiple areas.
* Vary the type of food options by including at least 4-5 different vendors.

### Main.py – The menu page where all main options are stored.
* Header Comments
* Create a main page where users can navigate to the different python pages and back.

### Your Choice – Choose something else that you want to offer to customers and create the page.
* Header Comments

###  Must Haves Throughout Multiple Pages:
* Loops
* Lists
* Tuples
* Conditional Statements
* Variables
* Functions
* Built in modules
* User-defined modules  
* String Methods
* Booleans
* Operators
* Input
* String Formatters

### Flowcharts
* One flowchart for each page that accurately shows how each page flows and functions.

### Error Journals
* An error journal that shows the different errors you encountered throughout creating the app and how you fixed them.

## PBM Components

* 70% Project code
  * Emphasis is on the functionality, creativity, and complexity of the program. The code should be well-structured, efficient, and use appropriate Python features and structures learned in the course.
  * This component is the core of your PBM. It involves coding an original, unique program that demonstrates the skills you've learned in the course.
  * Should have at least two user-created modules.
  * Use Python libraries
  * Loops, Lists, Tuples, functions, string formatters, conditionals, input statements, etc.
* 10% Documentation and Reflection
  * This involves using header comments, inline comments (#comments), and docstrings to explain what the code does, how it works, and why certain decisions were made.
  * Header comments typically appear at the beginning of a Python file or a major section of the code and might include information like the project's name, author, date, and a brief description of the program's purpose.
  * Inline comments are used throughout the code to clarify complex logic, explain the purpose of specific blocks or lines of code, and make the code easier to understand for others (or for the student when they return to the code after some time).
  * Docstrings are used to describe the purpose and usage of functions, classes, methods, and modules. They are essential for anyone who will use these components of the code, either as part of a team or when sharing code publicly.
* 10% Flowchart
  * A flowchart is a visual representation of your program’s process. It should clearly illustrate how your program flows from start to end.
  * Include decision points, loops, major functions, and any conditional logic.
  * The flowchart should be detailed enough that someone could understand the basic operation of your program just by looking at it.
* 10% Error Journal
  * This is a record of the errors you encountered during your coding process. For each error, you should note:
    * The nature of the error.
    * Why it occurred.
    * How you diagnosed and fixed it.
  * The error journal is a reflection of your debugging process and shows how you engage with and resolve programming challenges.
  * This journal not only helps in understanding common mistakes and learning from them but also demonstrates your problem-solving and analytical skills.
